This our final project for the super cool course
22100 - R in Bio Data Science @ DTU

## Raw Data  ------------------------------------------------------

### From the study:

Walsh AM, Wechalekar MD, Guo Y, Yin X et al. Triple DMARD 
treatment in early rheumatoid arthritis modulates synovial T cell
activation and plasmablast/plasma cell differentiation pathways.
PLoS One 2017;12(9):e0183928. PMID: 28863153

Healthy subjects (n = 28) were defined as those who had no evidence of any form 
of arthritis on history or examination, and had no cartilage damage or synovitis 
on knee arthroscopy.

Patients with early RA (defined as within 12 months of onset of 
symptoms) (n = 19) had biopsies taken at baseline and after 6 months of 
treatment with tDMARDs administered per a treat-to-target protocol.
Patients did fulfill the 1987 revised American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR) and/or the 2010 ACR/ European League Against 
Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria. 

### From the study:

Guo, Yanxia, et al. “CD40L-dependent pathway is active at various stages of 
rheumatoid arthritis disease progression.” The Journal of Immunology 198.11 
(2017): 4490-4501.

Combined data of 236 RNA-seq synovial biopsy samples. Samples from patients with 
normal tissue, complain for arthralgia, early RA (defined as within 12 months 
of onset of symptoms), established RA, osteoarthritis and undifferentiated 
arthritis.
